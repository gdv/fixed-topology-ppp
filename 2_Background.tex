\begin{definition}
\label{definition:species-driven}
Let $T$ be a persistent phylogeny.
Then $T$ is called \emph{species-driven} if there exists a permutation
$(d_{1}, \ldots , d_{k})$ of all characters that are negated in $T$
such that for each $d_{i}$ there is a species $x_{i}$ whose path from
the root of $T$ to $x_{i}$ traverses the edge $d_{i}^{+}$ but does not
traverse any edge $d_{j}^{-}$ with $j \le i$.
